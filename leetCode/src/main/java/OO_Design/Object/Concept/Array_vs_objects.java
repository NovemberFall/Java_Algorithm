        - arrays are Objects
        - I cannot find the class for arrays:
            - True, the class declaration is not visible, but there still exists a class inside JVM.
            - each of the arrays created is an instance of that class.
            - remember `new` - it implies that there is a new object created.
        - the elements in the array still occupy consecutive memory space on the heap.
        - "length" is a field of the array object
        - array length cannot be changed after the array object is created(final)
