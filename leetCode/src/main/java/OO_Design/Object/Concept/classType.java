          Need access control to only expose functions we would like to expose.

          - public - everyone can access
          - protected - only my children and same package can access
          - default - only the same package can access
          - private - only myself can access (only at class level)

        TODO:
          - static - Members (fields, methods, classes) belong to class, not object.

        TODO:
          - Final - Constants "Once assigned, cannot be changed."
              - Final class: A class that cannot be derived
              - Final variable: A variabel that once assigned, cannot be assigned again.

        TODO:
          - Pass-by-value:
            Java is always pass-by-value (copy).
                - primitive type: copy of the value itself.
                - objects: copy of the object reference.
