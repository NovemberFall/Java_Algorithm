             - state(data): field - what things it maintains
             - behavior: methods
          2. Object also known as an instance which contains its own states.
          3. reference: each house also has an address, If you want to tell someone where the house is,
                you give them a card with address written on it. That card is the object's reference.
          4. `new` keyword: create an object
